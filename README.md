# Morse Code Trivia 

Final project for ECE198 at University of Waterloo

---

### Project Description 

You are asked three questions and must answer using the on board button.
The screen displays the entered morse sequence and the English translation as the user presses the button.

Mounted on the STM32 Nucleo-64 development board to avoid using external button, and connected to a 16x2 Char LCD for a slick minimalistic design.
